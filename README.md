A dead-simple backplane for your Docker Compose services - with free SSL and Git-based continuous delivery. Run any Docker app [manually](examples/) or from [backplane's app-store](http://portainer.127-0-0-1.nip.io/#!/1/docker/templates) in no time.

## Get started

> ðŸš€ Check out our [Examples](examples) section for quick-start templates for [Wordpress](examples/wordpress), [Sonarqube](examples/sonarqube) and more

```bash
pip install backplane
backplane init
backplane up
```

You can now visit the dashboards of [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) and [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) in your browser:

- [traefik.127-0-0-1.nip.io](http://traefik.127-0-0-1.nip.io)
- [portainer.127-0-0-1.nip.io](http://portainer.127-0-0-1.nip.io)

## Configure your Docker Compose services

Exposing one of your services through **backplane** is easy:

- add it to the `backplane` Docker network 
- add a label `backplane.enabled` with value `true`

**backplane** will automatically pick up the service's name (e.g. `whoami`) and exposes it as a subdomain of your **backplane domain** (defaults to `127-0-0-1.nip.io`).

> **NOTE**: this assumes that your service is accessible on port 80 inside the container. If that is NOT the case, see [Advanced configuration](#-advanced-configuration)

```yaml
version: "3.3"

services:
  whoami:
    image: "traefik/whoami"
    container_name: "whoami"
    networks:
      - backplane
    labels:
      - "backplane.enabled=true"

networks:
  backplane:
    external: true
```

Your service will be exposed as [http://whoami.127-0-0-1.nip.io](http://whoami.127-0-0-1.nip.io).

## Use backplane in the cloud

**backplane** can be used on public cloud hosts, too. Use `--https` and add a mail address for LetsEncrypt on installation to enable additional security for your applications. An optional `--domain` can be set on installation (defaults to `$SERVER_IP.nip.io`, e.g. `193-43-54-23.nip.io` if `--https` is set).

```bash
backplane install --https --mail letsencrypt@mydomain.com [--domain mydomain.com]
backplane up
```

This enables the following additional features:

- access your Docker Compose services as subdomains of `mydomain.com`
- automatic SSL for your Docker Compose services through LetsEncrypt (HTTP-Validation)
- automatic HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- sane security defaults

The Docker Compose stack definition doesn't change from the one without `--https`. **backplane** deals with the necessary configuration.

```yaml
version: "3.3"

services:
  whoami:
    image: "traefik/whoami"
    container_name: "whoami"
    networks:
      - backplane
    labels:
      - "backplane.enabled=true"

networks:
  backplane:
    external: true
```

Your container will be exposed as [https://whoami.mydomain.com](https://whoami.mydomain.com).

## Deploy to backplane (WIP)

`git push` your code to the built-in **shipmate** for dead-simple auto-deployment of your Docker Compose services. **shipmate** deploys whatever you define in the repository's `docker-compose.yml` file and can load additional environment variables from a `.env` file.

### Update your ssh config

> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | pbcopy

Add the following to your local `~/.ssh/config` file. This allows you to reach the runner under `backplane` without further configuration.

```bash
Host backplane
    HostName 127.0.0.1
    User backplane
    Port 2222
```

> **NOTE**: replace "HostName" with your server's IP if you're running in production

### Update your git remote

Assuming your repository is called `whoami`, this is how you add the **backplane runner** to your git remotes:

```bash
git remote add origin "git@backplane:whoami"
```

### Deploy to your server

```bash
git commit -am "feat: figured out who I am"
git push backplane master
```

That's it! **backplane** will build and deploy your application and expose it automatically.

## What is backplane

**backplane** consists of 3 main services running as Docker containers on your host:

- [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/), a very popular, cloud-native reverse-proxy
- [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/), a very popular management interface for Docker
- [shipmate](#), a simple software logistics solution

It aims to provide simple access to core prerequisites of modern app development:

- Endpoint exposure
- Container management
- Deployment workflows

To develop and run modern web-based applications you need a few core ingredients, like a reverse-proxy handling request routing, a way to manage containers and a way to deploy your code. **backplane** offers this for local development as well as on production nodes in a seemless way.

**shipmate** makes it easy to bypass long CI pipelines and deploy your application to a remote backplane host with ease.

**backplane** is mainly aimed at small to medium sized development teams or solo-developers that don't require complex infrastructure. Use it for rapid prototyping or simple deployment scenarios where the full weight of modern CI/CD and PaaS offerings just isn't bearable.

You can migrate from local development to production with a simple `git push` when using **backplane** on both ends. Think of it as a micro-PaaS that you can use locally.

## What backplane is NOT

- a PaaS solution; backplane only provides a well-configured reverse-proxy and a management interface for containers
- meant for production use. You can, though, but at your own risk

## Advanced configuration

**backplane** is only a thin wrapper around Traefik. If you require more complex routing scenarios or have more complex service setups (e.g. multiple domains per container), simply use Traefik's label-based configuration.

[Read more](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) in the docs.

### Expose containers with non-standard ports

**backplane** expects your services to listen to port 80 inside their containers. If that is not the case, you need to tell the backplane about it. Add the following additional labels to tell backplane your service is accessible on port 9000:

```yaml
labels:
  - backplane.enabled=true
  - "traefik.http.routers.custom.service=custom-http"
  - "traefik.http.services.custom-http.loadbalancer.server.port=9000"
```

## Examples

In the [examples](examples) directory you'll find examples showing how to integrate backplane with your existing services

Change to any of the example folders and run `docker-compose up`. The example's `README` will hold additional information on how to use it.
